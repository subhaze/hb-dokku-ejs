# Deploying on dokku

[Dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku) is a Docker powered mini-Heroku in around 100 lines of Bash.

If you’re familiar with using git in the command line, you’ll have no trouble deploying your Harp app to Dokku.

## Setup a dokku environment

You can install Dokku on your own by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/progrium/dokku#requirements) or another approach is using a DigitalOcean [dropplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-dokku-application).

## Setuping a development environment

**Requirements:** git, node 0.10.x, npm 1.2.x

### 1. Running locally

You'll need harp installed globally `npm install -g harp` then you can initiate the project via `harp init -b subhaze/hb-dokku-ejs <app-name-here>`. Harp will create a new directory based on your app's name with the files in this repository inside it. Now you can `cd <app-name-here>` and run `harp server` so get the project up and running locally.

### 2. Setting up the remote repo

You'll need to intiate a git repo via `git init` then you'll need to add files for git to track `git add .` and commit them `git commit -am "init commit"`. Now you'll need to setup your remote repo to connect to your dokku setup which would be something like the following: `git remote add dokku dokku@<your_domain>:<your_app_name>`. `<your-app-name>` can really be anything you like, but, remember this will be the sub-domain used to serve your app.

### 3. Deploying your app

Now all you have to do is start coding and commiting changes and when ready `git push dokku master` and you've just deployed your [harp](http://harpjs.com/) app!
